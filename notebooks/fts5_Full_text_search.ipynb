      "  Summary: Welcome to the Complexity Premia podcast by Coolabah Capital, hosted by Christopher Joye, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager at Coolabah Capital, and Ying Yi, a Portfolio Management Director at Coolabah Capital. The Complexity Premia podcast strives to deconstruct modern investment problems for wholesale (not retail) participants in capital markets. You can listen on your favourite podcast app, or you can find it on Spotify, Podbean or Apple Podcasts. In this new flash episode of the Complexity Premia podcast, Chris and Ying Yi discuss why Coolabah was extremely bearish heading into April, predicting large equity losses; why the team hedged 15-25% of all its credit risk through to 9 April; why they cut all hedges on this day and went aggressively long, buying over $4bn of bonds thereafter; and what the outlook in this new uncertain world looks like.¬† ¬†  This information is suitable for wholesale investors only and has been produced by Coolabah Capital Institutional Investments Pty Ltd ACN 605806059, which holds Australian Financial Services Licence No. 482238 (CCII).

      "  Summary: Come join my Patreon! https://patreon.com/c/HemlockPatreon Summary: In this powerful 2014 speech, journalist and author Chris Hedges dissects what he terms the \"psychosis of permanent war\" that grips the United States. He traces its origins to the anti-communist fervor following World War I, arguing that the Wilson administration pioneered modern mass propaganda techniques, manipulating public emotion rather than appealing to reason. Hedges contends that this permanent state of war, fueled by corporate interests and sustained by both political parties, has destroyed American democracy, corrupted core values like thrift and community, and replaced them with hedonism and the cult of the self. Drawing heavily on his experiences as a war correspondent in the Middle East, Latin America, and the Balkans, Hedges details the devastating human cost and destructive power of modern industrial warfare, critiquing US foreign policy interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and the consequences of Israeli actions in Gaza. He discusses how these actions often create more enemies than they defeat (blowback) and lead to the erosion of civil liberties at home through mass surveillance and laws undermining due process. Referencing thinkers like Dwight Macdonald and Sheldon Wolin (specifically the concept of \"inverted totalitarianism\"), Hedges argues that corporate power has effectively seized control, leaving mass civil disobedience as potentially the only recourse for citizens to reclaim agency. The speech also includes a Q&A segment touching on climate change activism, the limitations of electoral politics (including the Green Party), and the nature of resistance against entrenched power.

      "- The Chris Hedges Report\n",
      "  Summary: On this episode of The Chris Hedges Report, Chris Hedges speaks with filmmaker Alex Gibney about Gibney‚Äôs documentary series The Dark Money Game, which examines the ‚Äúlabyrinth of mirrors‚Äù that facilitates untraceable corruption through the American political system. Although both the Democratic and Republican parties have served the interests of the billionaire class since well before the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission Supreme Court ruling in 2010, the removal of restrictions on political spending created a system by which corporations could route millions of dollars in bribes through an intricate, opaque network of nonprofit organizations and super PACs.¬† ¬† FirstEnergy, a failing Ohio nuclear power operator, exploited this network to pay $60 million to former Ohio State Representative Larry Householder, in exchange for his support of a ‚ÄúClean Energy‚Äù bill that would award FirstEnergy $1.3 billion in benefits. Ohio Confidential, the first documentary in Gibney‚Äôs series, follows the affair, which was subject to an FBI investigation, and which offers a view into mechanisms of illegitimate influence which are rarely visible to the public. Nonetheless, Hedges notes, the FirstEnergy story is likely a ‚Äúmicrocosm of the whole system.‚Äù¬† ¬† The second film in the series, Wealth of the Wicked, portrays the contradictory but effective partnership between the anti-abortion Christian right and the billionaire class, which has used a variety of sordid tactics to sway the Supreme Court towards conservative and pro-corporate decisions. For example, Gibney describes how wealthy donors would ‚Äúengage in a kind of romance‚Äù with justices, offering expensive gifts and pursuing ‚Äúfriendships that ultimately would have the effect of turning their perspectives...‚Äù ¬† The faster the dark money flows through the American political system, the greater the power of the billionaire class to oppose regulations and steal wealth. ‚ÄúIt's a series of interlocking favors,‚Äù Gibney observes, ‚Äúbut all these interlocking favors, which‚Äîlet's face it‚Äîare traditional tools of the political system‚Ä¶ are made possible and made far more corrupt by the application of tens of millions of dollars, which to the public is completely invisible.‚Äù\n",

      "- The Chris Hedges Report\n",
      "  Summary: Richard Barnard, Sarah Wilkinson, Asa Winstanley and Richard Medhurst. These are some of the canaries in the coal mine for what is to come in the West as the region‚Äôs elite quickly becomes Israel‚Äôs international police. Medhurst joins host Chris Hedges on this episode of The Chris Hedges Report to talk about his own experiences in the United Kingdom and Austria, where federal agents and police arrested him and searched his home under draconian counterterrorism laws. ‚ÄúI was just trying to tell the truth as best as I could with the facts that we had at that time and that's it. And I think they're trying to make an example out of me, definitely,‚Äù Medhurst tells Hedges. Medhurst points to Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 in the UK as one of the broad laws being used to silence people like him. ‚ÄúIf they really want to, they can charge you for just saying a simple fact just because the fact is uncomfortable to the government or perhaps they can twist it into saying you're glorifying a group but it's not true,‚Äù he explains. For Medhurst, the UK pinned Schedule 12(1A) on him, which he explains ‚Äúhas never been used before, and escalated it straight to an arrest.‚Äù They then took his ‚Äúfingerprints, [his] DNA, [and] they put [him] in jail for 24 hours.‚Äù Despite his accurate reporting, Medhurst says that the validity of what one says does not matter when it conflicts with the establishment line. ‚ÄúYou're not glorifying anyone. You're just stating a fact, but they can still charge you. That's what's so dangerous about this law,‚Äù he said. Austrian security service agents still possess most of Medhurst‚Äôs journalistic tools. There is still no clear time table as to when he will get his tools back. As Medhurst explained: ‚ÄúIt wasn't just my phone and my laptop, which I also use for work, which are my work tools, but ‚Ä¶you know, hard drive adapters, things that don't even have data on them, analog microphones. Why would you do that to someone unless you're trying to make a point that you don't want them to continue their work?‚Äù\n",
